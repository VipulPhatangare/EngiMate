## Project Name:
**EngiMate** - Smart College Predictor and AI Counseling Assistant

## Project Abstract:

Every year, lakhs of students in Maharashtra appear for the MHT CET exam, but most struggle with the confusing and time-consuming admission process. With nearly 6.75 lakh students competing for limited seats, the challenges of understanding branch-wise cutoffs, filling choices effectively, and tracking counselling updates often lead to poor decision-making. This results in vacant seats even in top colleges, highlighting the inefficiency of the current system.

To solve this, the **SynthoMind** team has developed **EngiMate**, a smart, student-centric digital platform that combines college prediction, AI guidance, and personalized dashboards into one solution.

### Key Features:
- **Smart College Predictor**: Using previous year cutoffs, seat matrix data, and student preferences like marks, category, or location, the platform provides accurate recommendations
- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Answers counselling queries in real time using advanced AI models
- **Personalized Dashboard**: Allows students to filter colleges, save favorites, and export results as PDF for easy reference
- **Real-time Guidance**: Centralizes all essential information and provides instant support

By simplifying the MHT CET admission journey, EngiMate saves time, reduces confusion, and empowers students to make confident, data-driven choices.
